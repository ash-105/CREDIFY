The price increase in question was brought by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) through issuance of SRO 1608(I)/2018, SRO 1609(I)/2018, SRO 1610(I)/2018 and SRO 34 (I)/2019 during the incumbent government’s tenure. The first three increased the prices only for certain hardship drugs. The last SRO only allows a 9% increase for hardship drugs and 15% for remaining drugs.Thus, while drug prices have indeed risen, those of certain hardship drugs disproportionately so, her claim that medicine prices have risen over 200 per cent in the past 11 months is false.',\n",

       "  'The cost of a certificate to own a large family car in Singapore has jumped to a fresh record high of S$146,002 ($106,619; £87,684). The city-state introduced the 10-year certificate of entitlement (COE) system in 1990 as an anti-congestion measure. Prospective car owners in Singapore must have a COE in order to be able to purchase a vehicle. They are sold in auctions every two weeks, with the government controlling the number of certificates for sale. With taxes and import duties, the system has made Singapore the most expensive country in the world to buy a car. For example, a new standard Toyota Camry Hybrid costs around S$250,000 in Singapore, which includes the cost of a COE and taxes. That is about six times more expensive than in the US.'],\n",
